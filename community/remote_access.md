## OctoEverywhere

[OctoEverywhere](https://octoeverywhere.com/) empowers you with free, secure, and unlimited remote access to your full Klipper web portal from anywhere, including full-frame rate webcam streaming. OctoEverywhere is a maker community project with servers worldwide, providing a fast and secure connection.

Along with remote access, OctoEverywhere recently launched free and unlimited next-generation AI print failure detection called [Gadget](https://octoeverywhere.com/gadget). Gadget watches for many print failure types and will alert you or pause your print if detected, saving you time and money.

OctoEverywhere also offers print notifications via push notifications, Telegram, SMS, Discord, and others, print live streaming, shared access, and remote access for apps like Mobileraker. It only takes about 20 seconds to set up OctoEverywhere. [Here's the link to get started.](https://octoeverywhere.com/getstarted)
